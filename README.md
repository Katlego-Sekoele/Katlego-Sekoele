## Personal Motivation
As a final year student at the University of Cape Town, I am passionate about using my knowledge of computer science and business computing to make a positive impact. With a strong affinity for learning and a passion for technology, I am a firm believer in the power of continuous learning and improvement. I follow the CL/CI (continuous learning and continuous improvement) framework (totally made up), which guides me in my pursuit of personal and professional growth.

In addition to my passion for technology and education, I am also interested in gaming, software development, and business. I am always looking for ways to combine my interests and skills to address niche problems and create innovative solutions.

Throughout my academic career, I have proven myself to be a strong academic achiever and a self-motivated student. I am proud to have been on the Dean's Merit List for the entire duration of my undergraduate degree. I am not afraid to ask questions, seek out new challenges, and learn from my peers and those more knowledgeable than I am. 

I am excited to see where my studies will take me and to continue pursuing my passion for computer science. Connect with me on LinkedIn to learn more about my experience and interests.
